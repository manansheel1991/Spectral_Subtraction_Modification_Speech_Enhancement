# spectral_subtraction_modification
Implementation of a modification of the classic Spectral Subtraction Method, that helps in decreasing the musical noise.

The file 'Spectral_Subtraction_My_Code' contains the MATLAB code.

The files 'APT Project Report Final' and 'APT Abstract Manan Sheel' contain the project documentation.

The files 'noisy_babble' and 'noisy_train' are the speech files in which noise is mixed, and which we can give as inputs to the MATLAB Code.
